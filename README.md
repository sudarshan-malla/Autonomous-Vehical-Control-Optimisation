# "Autonomous interaction control scheme based on convex optimisation in vehicular cyber-physical systems"
1. Autonomous Interaction Control Scheme: This refers to a method or algorithm that governs how autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with each other and the environment (e.g., in traffic scenarios). It includes things like lane changing, merging, maintaining safe distances, and cooperative behaviors.

2. Based on Convex Optimisation: Convex optimization ensures that a global optimum can be found efficiently. In this context, it's used to determine optimal control inputs (like speed, acceleration, or path) for vehicles based on constraints like safety, traffic laws, and comfort.

3. Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS): VCPS are systems where physical components (vehicles, roads) and computational elements (controllers, sensors, V2X communication) are tightly integrated.
